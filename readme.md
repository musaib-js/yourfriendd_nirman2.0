# Problem Domain: Healthcare
# Subdomain: Mental Health

# Actual Problem: Mental Health is one of the most important concerns of the world. Majority of the people suffer from mental health issues and the <b> social stigma - labelling depressed people as mad or idiosyncrats</b> adds to the severity of the issue. Owing to this social stigma, people scupper to visit doctors, if they suffer from mental health issues and finally land themselves in severe mental disorders. 

# Solution: Our idea is to develop an online mental health consultation platfrom, where the sufferers can connect with the doctors in real time online and get consultation and counselling, thus bypassing the social stigma. Our site would be having doctors and clinical pyschologists to address the issues of people. In case of absence of the experts, there are facilities like self care and telecaller besides reading motivational blogposts by the counselors and videos uploaded by them. There'd be realtime counselling sessions on the app and also the user can have a conversation over chat also.
